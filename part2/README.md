## Todo list in Elm
This is a simple todo list for the purpose of learning Elm.
---
### Usage

Start the app via
```
elm reactor
```

---
### Goal
Be able to add multiple items to the TODO list.

There's documentation on the cons (::) operator [here](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/List#(::)).
