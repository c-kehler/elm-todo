## Todo list in Elm
This is a simple todo list for the purpose of learning Elm.
---
### Usage

Start the app via
```
elm reactor
```

---
### Goal
Get `main.elm` to compile.

This is actually a copy of the original elm-todo repo that has bit rot.
Essentially we are upgrading this Elm module to be compatible with version `0.19`.
